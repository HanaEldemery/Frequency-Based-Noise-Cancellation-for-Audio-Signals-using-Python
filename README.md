# Signals
I focused on noise cancellation in an audio signal. The objective was to handle noise interference generated by a child pressing two random piano keys during a song playback. This noise was represented by two random frequencies selected from the third and fourth octaves of the piano frequency range.
To begin with, I imported the necessary libraries for frequency domain conversion, specifically using scipy.fftpack for performing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations. I set the number of samples to be three times 1024 and defined the frequency axis range accordingly.
The first step involved converting the time-domain signal of the song into the frequency domain using FFT. This transformation allowed me to analyze the frequency components of the signal. Subsequently, I generated the noise signal using sine functions at the two randomly selected frequencies. This noise was then added to the original signal to create a noisy version of the song.
I converted this noisy signal into the frequency domain to observe the effects of the added noise. I noticed that the noisy signal exhibited two distinct high-frequency peaks corresponding to the frequencies of the noise components. To identify these noise frequencies, I found the indices of the peaks in the frequency domain representation of the noisy signal, ensuring that the identified peaks were above the maximum peak of the original signal.
After identifying the noise frequencies, I rounded these values to avoid double precision errors and subtracted the tones corresponding to these frequencies from the noisy signal. This filtering step aimed to remove the noise components, resulting in a cleaner signal. Finally, I played the filtered signal to verify that the noise was successfully removed and the original sound quality was restored.
This project demonstrated my ability to apply frequency domain techniques to audio signal processing and effectively handle noise cancellation.
